# TaskRecorderPrototype

# Motivation
I once created a program for personal use with same functionality but only using console. Therefore, I code this app to further my knowledge in event-driven application. Also I try to add some more functionality I want into it.


# Feature
Keep track of work time. 

This app is in C++ and use wxWidget as the main tool. 

Please note that this is just a prototype for personal use. A more sophisticate version will come in the future.

This app was create for multi-flatform according to wxWidget standards. However, it is only tested on Ubuntu for now.

# Usage
This app required wxWidget version 3.0.4 or later.

For Linux, run $make inside Source folder to generate TaskRecorder.
